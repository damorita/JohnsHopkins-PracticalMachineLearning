This repository is to store the code created for the coursera Practical Machine Learning Peer Review Assignment

### Summary
The purpose of this assignment is to apply machine learning priciples to the exercise data set and predict the classe of the excercise based on a record's attributes. First a decision tree model was used with a 10 k fold cross validation. However, this machine learning method could not yield a confident enough prediction model to be utilized in the testing assignment (Less than 50% rate of accuracy). The next model built utilized random forest method which was able to produce a much better rate of accuracy when predicting (Over 90%). The results of the random forest method model on the test data set can be found at the end of the report.

###Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
